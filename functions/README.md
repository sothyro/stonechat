# Cloud Functions – Stonechat Communications

Firebase Cloud Functions for appointments (slots, booking, PlasGate SMS) and contact form (Resend email).

## PlasGate SMS setup

When a new document is created in the `appointments` collection, **3 SMS** are sent (sender **PlasGateUAT**): (1) customer, (2) admin, (3) Stonechat business line (+85512222211).

### Required secrets

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `PLASGATE_PRIVATE_KEY` | Your PlasGate API private key |
| `PLASGATE_SECRET` | Your PlasGate secret (X-Secret header) |
| `ADMIN_SMS_PHONE` | Admin phone (E.164, e.g. `855XXXXXXXXX`) to receive an SMS when a booking is **created by admin** on behalf of a client. Set to `0` to disable. **Must be set at least once** (e.g. to `0`) for deploy to succeed. |

**Option A – Script (recommended)**  
From project root, set env vars and run:

```powershell
# PowerShell (use single quotes so $ in secret is not expanded)
$env:PLASGATE_PRIVATE_KEY='your_private_key'
$env:PLASGATE_SECRET='your_secret'
node functions/scripts/set-plasgate-secrets.cjs
```

**Option B – Manual**  
From project root:

```bash
firebase functions:secrets:set PLASGATE_PRIVATE_KEY
firebase functions:secrets:set PLASGATE_SECRET
```

Paste the values when prompted. Then deploy:

```bash
cd functions && npm ci && cd ..
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### Testing SMS

- **From the app**: Book a consultation and confirm; an SMS is sent to the phone number you enter.
- **Callable `sendTestSms`**: Requires an authenticated user. Call with `{ "phone": "855XXXXXXXXX", "message": "Optional text" }` to send a test SMS and confirm PlasGate is working.

### Behaviour

On every new booking (customer or admin):

1. **Customer SMS**: Sent to the customer's phone (from the booking). Message: consultation confirmed, date, time, ref. If phone is invalid or missing, customer SMS is skipped and `smsStatus: "skipped"` is set on the document.
2. **Admin SMS**: Sent to `ADMIN_SMS_PHONE` (summary: name, date, time, ref, customer phone). Skipped if secret not set or invalid.
3. **Stonechat business SMS**: Always sent to the configured business number with the same summary.

Phone numbers are normalized to E.164. One automatic retry on 5xx or network errors per SMS. Customer SMS result is written to the appointment document (`smsStatus`, `smsSentAt`, and on failure `smsErrorReason`, `smsErrorBody`, etc.).
