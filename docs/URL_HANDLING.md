# URL handling and deep links

## Root-cause analysis: why URLs failed after refresh or cache clearing

### 1. Initial location ignored the browser URL

**Cause:** The app’s `GoRouter` was created with a fixed `initialLocation: '/'`. When the user opened a direct link (e.g. `https://site.com/events`) or refreshed on a deep link, the following happened:

- The browser kept the correct URL (e.g. `/events`).
- Flutter (and the router) started later. When `createAppRouter()` ran, it always used `initialLocation: '/'`.
- The router therefore started in the “home” state. On web, that could overwrite the address bar to `/` or leave the bar at `/events` while the app showed the home screen, depending on timing and implementation.

So the **root cause** of “wrong or blank page after refresh / reopen / cache clear” was: **the router never used the browser’s current URL as the initial route**. It always started at `/`, so deep links and refreshes did not restore the intended screen.

### 2. Trailing slashes made paths “unknown”

**Cause:** Valid paths were matched against a fixed set (e.g. `/events`, `/book`). Paths with a trailing slash (e.g. `/events/`) were not in that set, so the redirect logic treated them as unknown and sent the user to `/not-found`. Shared or bookmarked URLs with a trailing slash could therefore land on the 404 page.

### 3. Server and redirect config (already correct)

The app already had:

- Path-based URLs via `usePathUrlStrategy()` in `main.dart`.
- SPA fallback so that `/events`, `/book`, etc. serve `index.html` (e.g. `.htaccess`, `_redirects`).

So **direct hits and refreshes were not failing because of server config**; they were failing because the **client-side router did not initialize from the current URL** and did not normalize paths.

## Implemented fix (routing / state layer)

1. **Initial location from browser (web)**  
   When running on web (`kIsWeb`), the router’s initial location is taken from `Uri.base` (path + query + fragment) instead of a hard-coded `'/'`. So:
   - Direct link to `/events` or `/book` opens the correct screen.
   - Refresh on any valid URL keeps that URL and screen.
   - Cache clear and reopen with a saved URL still loads the correct page, because the first thing the router does is use the browser’s URL.

2. **Path normalization**  
   A single `normalizePath()` helper:
   - Leaves `/` as is.
   - Removes a trailing slash from other paths (e.g. `/events/` → `/events`).
   - Used both when computing the initial location and in the redirect callback.

3. **Redirect logic**  
   - **Trailing slash:** If the current path has a trailing slash, the redirect returns the canonical path (no trailing slash), preserving query and fragment. So `/events/` and `/events?foo=1` both resolve to the same route and a clean URL.
   - **Unknown paths:** Unchanged: unknown paths still redirect to `/not-found`.
   - **Auth:** Unchanged: `/consultations/dashboard` still redirects to `/consultations` when the user is not logged in.

4. **SPA redirect file**  
   `web/_redirects` was normalized to the usual SPA rule: `/* /index.html 200`, so all routes are served `index.html` and the client router can handle them.

## Developer note: URL-handling behavior and constraints

### Current behavior

- **Web:** On load (including after refresh or cache clear), the router’s initial location is the **current browser URL** (path + query + fragment). Direct links, bookmarks, and shared links open the correct screen.
- **Path format:** Paths are normalized: no trailing slash except for `/`. So `/events` and `/events/` are equivalent; the app redirects `/events/` to `/events`.
- **Unknown paths:** Any path not in the known set (see `_knownPaths` in `app_router.dart`) redirects to `/not-found` (404 inside the app shell).
- **Query and fragment:** Query parameters and hash fragments are preserved when normalizing (e.g. `/events?month=3` and `#section`).

### Adding or changing routes

1. **Register the path**  
   Add the new path to `_knownPaths` in `lib/router/app_router.dart` (e.g. `'/my-page'`). If you don’t, the redirect will send that path to `/not-found`.

2. **Add the route**  
   Add a matching `GoRoute` (or nested route) under the same `ShellRoute` so the path is actually handled.

3. **Server / hosting**  
   Ensure your host still serves `index.html` for the new path (your existing SPA rule `/* → index.html` usually covers this).

### Constraints

- **Subpath deployment:** If the app is deployed under a subpath (e.g. `https://site.com/app/`), the **base href** must be set (e.g. in `web/index.html` via `$FLUTTER_BASE_HREF`). The current code assumes the app is at the root or that `Uri.base` already reflects the base (as with Flutter’s default build). If you deploy under a subpath and see wrong or blank routes, you may need to strip the base path from `Uri.base.path` before passing it to the router (e.g. in `getInitialRouterLocation()`).
- **Auth and redirect:** `/consultations/dashboard` redirects to `/consultations` when the user is not logged in. That happens in the same redirect callback; keep that in mind if you add more auth-only routes.
- **Tests:** Router/URL behavior is covered by `test/router_url_test.dart`: unit tests for `normalizePath()` always run; widget tests for redirect and not-found are skipped in CI (full-app layout overflows in the test viewport). Verify deep link and refresh behavior manually on web (open `/events`, refresh; open `/events/` and confirm redirect to `/events`; open `/unknown` and confirm 404). Run: `flutter test test/router_url_test.dart`.
